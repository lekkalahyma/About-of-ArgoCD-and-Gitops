Deploy the sample application using Argocd

I deployed a sample Nginx application on a Minikube cluster using Argo CD.

First, the application was created with the following settings:
App Name: test
Project Name: default
Sync Policy: Automatic
Prune Propagation Policy: foreground

In the source section:
Repository URL: https://lnkd.in/gNkwxkKH
Revision: HEAD
Path: charts/hello-world

Destination settings:
Cluster URL: https://kubernetes.default.svc
Namespace: test (created using the command: kubectl create ns test)

Additionally, in the Helm section:
Values Files: values.yaml
After creating the app, it appeared in the Argo CD UI. Accessing the application, I initiated the synchronization and started the deployment.


For example, to increase the number of replicas:
Navigate to the app details section.
Adjust the parameters by setting replica=10.
This action increased the number of pods accordingly.

To check the application on my local machine, I used curl 192.168.49.2:31808. 
However, to access the application locally, I needed to perform port forwarding
socat TCP-LISTEN:31808,fork TCP:192.168.49.2:127.0.0.1

This setup allowed me to access the application via 127.0.0.1:31808 on my local system.
